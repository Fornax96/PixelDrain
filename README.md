PixelDrain
========

### This application was my very first Java project ever, it has very buggy and inefficient code.
### A newer version of the client already exists but is not open sourced yet

Application for taking screenshots and other files and uploading them to a web server for sharing.
You can download the latest version from GitHub: [DOWNLOAD][2]. To install extract the zip archive to some directory and run PixelDrain.jar

This software was developed on Linux but due to some [bugs in the JVM][1] it works better on Windows
